# Directive: "The Discovery Session" - Conversational Client Onboarding

## Mission Statement
Transform the boring multi-step form into a **conversational discovery experience** that feels like chatting with a friendly expert. The goal is to extract everything needed to build a stunning website while making the client feel excited about their project - not overwhelmed by forms.

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Traditional Onboarding
- Forms feel like homework
- Non-technical clients don't know what "brand hex codes" means
- Dropouts happen when people feel confused or overwhelmed
- Generic questions get generic answers (useless for design)

### The SEOJack Approach
- **Conversational, not transactional** - feels like talking to a designer friend
- **Smart defaults** - pre-fill based on industry, let them customize
- **Show, don't ask** - use visual choices instead of text inputs where possible
- **Progressive disclosure** - only ask what's relevant based on previous answers
- **Celebrate progress** - make completing each section feel rewarding

---

## The Experience Flow

### Phase 1: "Let's Get Acquainted" (The Warm-Up)
**Purpose:** Build rapport, capture basic business info, set the tone.

**Questions to ask (conversationally):**

1. **Business Name**
   - "First things first - what's your business called?"
   - Auto-suggest domain availability as they type (e.g., "✓ smithplumbing.co.uk is available!")

2. **Industry/Trade** 
   - "What do you do?" 
   - Show visual cards with icons: Plumber 🔧 | Electrician ⚡ | Cleaner 🧹 | Builder 🏗️ | Landscaper 🌳 | Other
   - This selection drives smart defaults for the entire flow

3. **Location**
   - "Where are you based? This helps us target the right customers."
   - Simple city/region input with autocomplete
   - Follow-up: "Do you travel to customers, or do they come to you?"

4. **How long in business?**
   - Visual slider or buttons: "Just starting" | "1-2 years" | "3-5 years" | "5+ years veteran"
   - This affects tone suggestions later

**Transition:** "Brilliant! Now let's figure out what makes [Business Name] special..."

---

### Phase 2: "What Makes You Different" (The Gold Mining)
**Purpose:** Extract the unique selling points that make compelling website copy.

**Questions to ask:**

1. **The "Pub Test"**
   - "Imagine you're at the pub and someone asks what you do. What do you tell them?"
   - Free text, but with example prompts based on their industry:
     - Plumber example: "I'm a plumber in Manchester - been doing it 15 years. I specialise in boiler repairs and I'm the guy people call when other plumbers have given up."
   - This becomes the basis for their "About" section

2. **Services Offered**
   - "What services do you offer? Tick all that apply."
   - Pre-populated checklist based on industry selection (smart defaults!)
   - Plumber: ☑️ Boiler Repair | ☑️ Emergency Callouts | ☑️ Bathroom Installation | ☑️ Central Heating | ☐ Commercial Work
   - "Add your own" option at bottom

3. **The Secret Sauce**
   - "What do your happiest customers say about you?"
   - Multiple choice with personality:
     - "Always on time" ⏰
     - "Explains everything clearly" 💬
     - "Leaves the place spotless" ✨
     - "Fair prices, no surprises" 💷
     - "Goes above and beyond" 🌟
     - Let them pick top 3

4. **Qualifications & Trust Signals**
   - "Any certifications, memberships, or qualifications?"
   - Visual cards: Gas Safe | NICEIC | Checkatrade | TrustATrader | City & Guilds | Insurance badge
   - "These badges build instant trust on your website"

5. **Years of Experience / Jobs Completed**
   - "Roughly how many jobs have you completed?" 
   - Slider: 50+ | 100+ | 500+ | 1000+ | "Lost count!"
   - This becomes social proof: "Over 500 jobs completed"

**Transition:** "Love it. Now let's make sure your website actually brings in customers..."

---

### Phase 3: "Your Ideal Customer" (The Targeting)
**Purpose:** Understand who they serve so the website speaks directly to those people.

**Questions to ask:**

1. **Customer Type**
   - "Who's your ideal customer?"
   - Visual selection: 
     - 🏠 Homeowners
     - 🏢 Businesses  
     - 🏗️ Other tradespeople
     - 👵 Elderly/vulnerable (shows trust signals matter more)
     - Mix of above

2. **Service Area**
   - "How far do you travel for work?"
   - Interactive map or simple input: "Within X miles of [their location]"
   - Or: "Specific areas" with multi-select (postcodes/towns)

3. **Price Positioning**
   - "Where do you sit on price?"
   - Slider with descriptions:
     - Budget-friendly: "I compete on price"
     - Mid-range: "Fair prices for quality work"  
     - Premium: "I'm not the cheapest, but I'm worth it"
   - This affects website tone and messaging

4. **The Dream Job**
   - "What's your favourite type of job to get called out for?"
   - Free text - this reveals what to emphasize on the site
   - Example prompt: "Full bathroom renovations - I love seeing the transformation"

**Transition:** "Perfect. Now for the fun part - let's design how this looks..."

---

### Phase 4: "The Look & Feel" (The Visual Direction)
**Purpose:** Establish brand direction without asking technical questions.

**Questions to ask:**

1. **Website Inspiration** (THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION)
   - "Pick 2-3 websites you like the look of (any industry)"
   - Show curated gallery of 8-10 sites in different styles
   - Let them paste URLs too
   - We analyze: color palette, typography, layout style, imagery approach

2. **Vibe Check**
   - "How should your website feel to visitors?"
   - Visual mood board selection (not words - actual styled preview cards):
     - **Clean & Professional** - minimal, lots of white space, corporate feel
     - **Friendly & Approachable** - warm colors, rounded corners, casual
     - **Bold & Confident** - dark backgrounds, strong typography, impactful
     - **Traditional & Trustworthy** - classic layout, serif fonts, established feel
     - **Modern & Sleek** - cutting edge, gradients, contemporary

3. **Color Preference** (VISUAL, not hex codes!)
   - "Pick a color family that feels right for your brand"
   - Show pre-made palettes with names:
     - "Ocean" 🌊 (blues)
     - "Forest" 🌲 (greens)  
     - "Sunset" 🌅 (oranges/reds)
     - "Slate" 🪨 (grays/neutrals)
     - "Midnight" 🌙 (dark/dramatic)
     - "Custom" - simple color picker if they have brand colors

4. **Existing Brand Assets**
   - "Do you already have any of these?"
   - Checklist: Logo | Business cards | Van livery | Social media graphics | Photos of your work
   - For each "yes" - prompt upload or "I'll send later"

**Transition:** "Almost there! Just a few more details..."

---

### Phase 5: "The Essentials" (The Practical Stuff)
**Purpose:** Capture must-have info for the actual build.

**Questions to ask:**

1. **Contact Preferences**
   - "How should customers reach you?"
   - Checkboxes: Phone | Email | WhatsApp | Contact form | Facebook Messenger
   - "What's the best number/email for customers?"

2. **Business Hours**
   - "When are you available?"
   - Quick presets: "Mon-Fri 9-5" | "Mon-Sat 8-6" | "24/7 Emergency" | "Custom"
   - Toggle: "Show hours on website?" (some tradespeople prefer flexibility)

3. **Social Media**
   - "Got any social media we should link to?"
   - Icons for: Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube | LinkedIn | Google Business
   - Just paste URLs

4. **Existing Website/Domain**
   - "Do you have a website currently?"
   - Yes → "What's the URL? We'll review it for content we can reuse"
   - No → "Do you have a domain name, or shall we help with that?"

5. **Photos**
   - "Photos of your work make a HUGE difference. Can you share some?"
   - Drag-and-drop uploader
   - Prompts: "Before/after shots" | "You at work" | "Your van/team" | "Happy customers"
   - "Don't worry if you don't have many - we have strategies for that"

6. **Reviews/Testimonials**
   - "Where do your best reviews live?"
   - Quick links to pull from: Google | Facebook | Checkatrade | Bark | TrustPilot
   - Or: "Paste a few of your favourite customer quotes"

**Transition:** "One final question..."

---

### Phase 6: "The Finish Line" (The Commitment)
**Purpose:** Clarify goals and timeline, create urgency.

1. **Primary Goal**
   - "What's the #1 thing you want this website to do?"
   - Visual cards:
     - 📞 "Get my phone ringing with enquiries"
     - 📅 "Let customers book online"
     - 🏆 "Look more professional than competitors"
     - 📍 "Show up on Google for my area"
     - 💼 "Win bigger/better jobs"

2. **Timeline**
   - "How soon do you need this live?"
   - Options: "Yesterday!" 🔥 | "Within 2 weeks" | "Within a month" | "No rush, get it right"

3. **Anything Else?**
   - "Anything else we should know? Dream features? Specific requests? Horror stories from past web designers?"
   - Free text field
   - This often reveals the most valuable insights

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management
- Save progress after EVERY question (not just each phase)
- Use localStorage for anonymous users, sync to Firebase on account creation
- Allow "Save & Continue Later" with magic link sent to email

### Smart Defaults by Industry
Create JSON config files for each industry containing:
```javascript
{
  industry: "plumber",
  defaultServices: ["Boiler Repair", "Emergency Callouts", "Bathroom Installation"],
  commonCertifications: ["Gas Safe", "CIPHE"],
  typicalCustomers: ["Homeowners"],
  suggestedVibe: "Friendly & Approachable",
  colorSuggestion: "Ocean",
  sampleQuestions: ["24-hour emergency service?", "Free quotes?"],
  competitorExamples: ["pimlicoplumbers.com", "dyno.com"]
}
```

### Progress Indication
- Use a progress bar that fills smoothly (not step jumps)
- Show encouraging messages: "You're 60% done - most people finish in 4 minutes"
- Display a "Your website is taking shape!" preview that updates with their choices

### The Live Preview (Differentiator Feature)
As they answer questions, show a LIVE PREVIEW of their website being "built":
- Phase 1 complete → Show header with their business name
- Phase 2 complete → Show services section populated
- Phase 4 complete → Apply their chosen color scheme
- This creates dopamine hits and reduces abandonment

### Escape Hatches
- Every screen has "I'm not sure / Skip for now" option
- Chat widget always visible: "Stuck? Ask us anything"
- Phone number visible: "Prefer to talk? Call us"

### Mobile-First Design
- Assume 70%+ will do this on their phone
- Big tap targets, minimal typing
- Voice input option for free text fields
- Photo upload directly from camera

  "additionalNotes": "..."
}
```

## Success Metrics

Track and optimize:
- **Completion rate** - target 70%+ (industry average is ~40% for multi-step forms)
- **Time to complete** - target under 8 minutes
- **Abandonment points** - which questions cause dropoff?
- **Quality score** - are we getting enough info to build great sites?

---

## The SEOJack Difference

This isn't a form. It's a **discovery session** that:
1. Makes clients feel heard and understood
2. Extracts genuinely useful information (not generic fluff)
3. Builds excitement about their upcoming website
4. Positions SEOJack as the expert who "gets it"
5. Creates a seamless handoff to the design team

The client should finish thinking: "Wow, they really know what they're doing. I can't wait to see what they create."

*Remember: Every question should earn its place. If we can infer it or default it, don't ask it.*
